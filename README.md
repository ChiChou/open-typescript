# open-typescript

> No more typescript.d.ts !

Open-typescript is a clone of official TypeScript but expose all API definitions.
It's useful to someone who often using internal APIs. We needn't copy & paste the API definition from TypeScript anymore.

Happy hacking!

## Install

1. `yarn add open-typescript` or `npm i open-typescript`
2. `import 'open-typescript'` in some file.
3. Enjoy :XD
